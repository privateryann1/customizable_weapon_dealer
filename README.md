# Customizable Weapon Dealer

Coded this for a ClonewarsRP server that I developed. The code is not the best as it was my first time making a complex user interface. Configuration is mostly done in-game through the npc. Users with superadmin permission can access that. If you mess up and enter in an invalid weapon, go to your garrysmod data folder and delete the folder called 'lg'. This addon is by no means perfect and definitely has its flaws.
